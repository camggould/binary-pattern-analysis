# Binary Pattern Analysis

## Background

I have been working on several decade-old ciphers for the past year or so and wanted to organize analysis into one place. These ciphers are all known to be some form of classical encryption (possibly multiple layers) rather than modern encryption, but contain additional layers of obfuscation via tricky data encoding techniques. This extra layer has stumped analysts for a decade now, and I would like to take a crack at seriously analyzing them to possibly find a way out.
